Beginnings of a worker pool manager app.
This is not a general worker pool. It's made to fulfill specific requirements.

TODO:
- worker needs to finish all jobs before shutting down (empty out message queue),
  rewrite worker as a gen_fsm?
- worker behavior
- pass pool state to worker at init
- integrate with gen_bunny
